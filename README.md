# Lower-48-SPP-and-MST-
Using Dijkstra's and Kruskal's algorithm I have created some code that will produce the shortest path and minimum spanning tree for the lower 48 states.  

Importing csv files on states names, neighbors and scraping the neccesary data we are able to create the neccesary graph to be analyzed. 
It is a fairly simple concept, if you have any questions about the code or some functionality issues please feel free to email me at
